# üìà Stock Prediction Model with n8n Integration

## üß† 1. Introduction

This project integrates a stock price prediction machine learning model with an automated conversational workflow using [n8n](https://n8n.io/). The goal is to make intelligent stock price predictions easily accessible via a chat interface, powered by OpenAI and automated through n8n‚Äôs low-code automation platform.

## ‚ùì 2. Why is it needed?

- ‚úÖ **Accessibility**: Most ML models sit isolated in notebooks or dashboards. With this, users can get predictions through a chat.
- üîÅ **Automation**: Combining n8n and Langchain allows continuous interaction and real-time insights without manual intervention.
- üìä **Usability**: Perfect for financial analysts, trading bots, or data science learners to test live workflows and automation.

## üîÑ 4. n8n Workflow Overview

The workflow enables interaction with the ML model via a conversational agent using Langchain + OpenAI:

### üîß Nodes Used:

| Node Type                     | Purpose                                       |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `When Chat Message Received` | Triggers the workflow on new messages         |
| `AI Agent`                   | Central logic processing unit via Langchain   |
| `OpenAI Chat Model`          | GPT model (e.g. GPT-4o-mini) for responses    |
| `Simple Memory`              | Maintains conversational context              |
| `Calculator`                 | Performs computations if needed               |
| `SerpAPI`                    | Fetches external data (stock news/searches)   |

### üîÑ Workflow Flow:

- The AI Agent intelligently routes queries using tools like calculator, search API, and the ML prediction responses.
